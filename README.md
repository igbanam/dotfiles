# igbanam@'s dotfiles

Most of my TUI configs, featuringâ€¦

- Vim 9, as text editor
- TMux, as stage
- Git

### Reason
Every now and then, there is a new computer to setup. Over the years, I have been able to reduce setup times from weeks to days. With this, it's possible to reduce this to hours or minutes depending on internet speed.

### How To Use
* Clone the repository
* Link the corresponding dot file
